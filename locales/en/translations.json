    "p1": "This lab used to gather researchers from the research department of IGN, from Université Paris Est Marne la Vallée, and from ENSG Géomatique school. The lab was evaluated by AERES with the name 'Service de recherche de l'IGN' in 2010 and in 2012. Finally, in 2018, the research team on geodesy, called LAREG, joined another lab, UMR IPGP, and the remaining researchers decided to create a new LASTIG lab gathering and mixing the old research teams COGIT, LOEMI, and MATIS."
